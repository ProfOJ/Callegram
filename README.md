# Callegram - Telegram Mini App for scheduling call appointments with ease

Callegram is a Telegram Mini App that allows users to schedule and manage calls. It is built using vanilla html+css+js for the frontend, and fastapi+postgresql for the backend. Both components are dockerized and can be deployed using docker or docker-compose.

This Mini App is deployed and accessible at https://t.me/CallegramBot
